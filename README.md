ðŸ§¾ Project: Tally Multi-Year Auto Login Script (Python)

Every finance professional using Tally often needs to log in to multiple financial years manually, which can be time-consuming.
To save time, I developed a Python automation script that automatically opens multiple year-wise company files in Tally Software.

To use this script:

Keep Tally open on your system.

Arrange your windows so that you can switch between the Python script and the Tally screen using Ctrl + Tab.

The script will then automatically open previous-year files one by one.

You can easily modify the code to set the file paths for your previous-year data, ensuring smooth automation based on your Tally data structure.

Feel free to contact me if you need assistance or customization support.
